# UFOs

Overview:
  Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for             multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
  so we are going to use JavaScript and HTML, to modify index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter we created, we’ll add filters for     the city, state, country.
  
  Results and Analysis:
    After we added all these filters we got we got more convenience as we see in the following screenshots, now we can get more specific result with multiple keys         filters that wasn't able in the original code.

  Multiple filters Date State filter:

  Summary: 
    In general the new code got big improvement but still needs some enhansment as the search filters now case sensitive so I have to be careful about the key workds       should all of them lowercases letters outherwise, we will not get any results, and also it shuld be the complete keyword.
